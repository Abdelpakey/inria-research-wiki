Research wiki
=============

My research involves an important bibliography component, reading papers closely or marginally related to my subject.
I've been struggling to find an efficient way to store and retrieve the information I have collected when reading such papers (as I unfortunately do not have an eiditic memory)

This is my attempt to use github's wiki for this purpose.

My research subject is action recognition in first-person view videos (filmed on chest of head-mounted cameras).

This triggered readings on various related subjects :
