Research wiki
=============

My research involves an important bibliography component, reading papers closely or marginally related to my subject.
I've been struggling to find an efficient way to store and retrieve the information I have collected when reading such papers (as I unfortunately do not have an eiditic memory)

This is my attempt to use github's wiki for this purpose.

My research subject is action recognition in first-person view videos (filmed on chest of head-mounted cameras).

This triggered readings on various related subjects :

- [hand pose estimation](https://github.com/hassony2/inria/wiki/hand-papers)
- [body pose estimation](https://github.com/hassony2/inria/wiki/body-papers)
- [grasp recognition](https://github.com/hassony2/inria/wiki/grasp-papers)
- [semantic segmentation](https://github.com/hassony2/inria/wiki/segmentation-papers)
- [action recognition](https://github.com/hassony2/inria/wiki/action-papers)
